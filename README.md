🎯 Research Challenge

This study addresses critical limitations in current cirrhosis prediction methods by developing robust machine learning pipelines that can:

· Handle clinical data complexity effectively
· Manage class imbalance in medical datasets
· Improve prediction accuracy for early intervention

🛠️ Methodology

Comprehensive ML Pipeline:

1. Feature Selection: Identifying most predictive clinical features
2. Categorical Data Encoding: Effective handling of clinical variables
3. Data Balancing: Using SVMSMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance
4. Multi-Model Evaluation: Comprehensive testing of five ML algorithms

Machine Learning Models Evaluated:

· Logistic Regression - Traditional statistical classifier
· Support Vector Machine - Maximum margin classifier
· XGBoost - Gradient boosting framework
· AdaBoost - Adaptive boosting algorithm
· K-Nearest Neighbors - Instance-based learning

📊 Key Clinical Features Identified

The study identified critical predictive features for cirrhosis outcomes:

· Hepatomegaly (Liver enlargement)
· Bilirubin levels - Key liver function marker
· Other significant clinical and laboratory parameters

🚀 Main Contributions

1. Data-Driven Predictive Framework

· Developed a comprehensive framework significantly improving cirrhosis outcome classification accuracy
· Integrated SVMSMOTE for effective data balancing in clinical datasets

2. Clinical Insights

· Identified hepatomegaly and bilirubin as key predictive features
